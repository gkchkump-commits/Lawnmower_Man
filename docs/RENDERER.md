# Renderer app (chat, voice pipeline, UI)

The renderer is everything in the window around the hologram: the conversation state machine,
the speech pipeline, the chat panel and the settings. It talks to the Electron main process only
through `window.lawnmower` (contract §3); in a plain browser it uses a mock of the same API.

```
src/main.js              bootstrap: bridge → settings → speech/audio → UI → avatar → controller
src/bridge/              index.js (real bridge or mock), mock.js, mock-voice.js (in-page fake voice server)
src/app/                 controller.js      conversation state machine (contract §7)
                         sentence-chunker.js streaming text → speakable chunks
                         speech-text.js     Markdown → speech text
                         speech-queue.js    ordered TTS with limited parallel prefetch
                         permission.js      tool-call summaries, spoken prompts and cues
                         click-through.js   setIgnoreMouse decisions with hysteresis
                         gaze.js            cursor position (desktop-wide in Electron) → avatar.lookAt
                         settings-defaults.js renderer copy of the §4 defaults, getPath/patchFor
                         emitter.js         tiny event emitter

## Conversation

`idle → listening → transcribing → thinking → speaking → idle`, mirrored on `body[data-state]`.

* Typed text enters at *thinking*. Sending while Claude is busy pre-empts the current reply
  (speech stops, the turn is interrupted, its partial text stays in the chat).
* Streamed text goes to the transcript (safe Markdown, re-rendered at most once per frame) and,
  when replies are spoken, through the sentence chunker → `toSpeechText` → the speech queue.
  The first chunk may be cut early at a clause (~40 characters) for a fast first sound; code
  blocks and tables are never spoken ("I've put the code in the chat.").
* Speech: the local voice server (Kokoro, with a viseme timeline) when it is running, otherwise
  the browser's speech synthesis (best English voice), otherwise text only. Up to two sentences
  are synthesized ahead of the one playing.
* Lip-sync each frame: visemes at the playback clock (with coarticulation) → `avatar.setMouth`;
  without visemes the audio spectrum drives the mouth; for browser speech, word boundaries drive
  a syllable oscillator. Loudness → `avatar.setSpeechLevel`.
* Tool calls show as chips; if Claude goes straight to a tool the avatar says a short cue.
  Permission requests (agent mode) show a card with Allow/Deny and a spoken prompt. Nothing is
  ever approved automatically. Cards disappear when their turn ends or the CLI restarts.
* Voice input needs the local voice server (faster-whisper). Without it the mic button is
  disabled and its tooltip explains how to install/enable it.
* Hands-free (setting): a VAD listens whenever the conversation is idle and pauses while the
  avatar thinks or speaks (half-duplex, so it never hears itself).
* After 10 idle minutes the avatar dozes (`sleep` state); any activity wakes it.

## Using it

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Enter / Shift+Enter | send / new line (↑ recalls the last messages) |
| hold **Space** (focus not in a text field) | push-to-talk; release to send |
| mic button | click: listen until you stop talking (click again to stop); hold: push-to-talk |
| **Esc** | close settings · cancel listening · stop speaking · otherwise stop the reply |
| send button while busy | becomes Stop |
| global hotkeys (Settings › Shortcuts) | talk / interrupt, stop speaking, show/hide chat |
| drag the head (or the status line) | move the window |

The window is the 2:3 avatar area plus, when the chat panel is on, a strip below it. With the
panel off (minimal mode) the panel floats over the avatar while something happens or the pointer
is near, and hides when idle. With click-through on (Windows/macOS), clicks on transparent
pixels reach the desktop; the head, the panel and cards stay clickable.

## Browser preview (no Electron)

`npm run build && npm run preview`, or Vite dev, then open `index.html?mock=1`:

| URL parameter | Effect |
|---|---|
| `mock=1` | use the mock bridge (also automatic when `window.lawnmower` is missing) |
| `voice=fake` | in-page fake voice server: spoken replies with visemes, canned speech recognition |
| `voice=http://127.0.0.1:PORT&voiceToken=T` | a real voice server, e.g. `LAWNMOWER_VOICE_TOKEN=T python -m lawnmower_voice --fake --port PORT` (from `voice/`; CORS allows 127.0.0.1:5173/4173) |
| `mockDelay=ms`, `mockFirst=ms` | streaming speed of the mock |
| `settings={"avatar":{"quality":"low"}}` | initial settings patch |
| `clickThrough=1` | exercise click-through decisions (recorded in `__app.bridge.__mock.calls`) |
| `layout=electron` | use the desktop window's layout rule |
| `bg=desk` | a colourful backdrop to judge transparency |

The mock streams canned replies: a greeting ("hello"), a code example ("code"), a Markdown
showcase ("markdown"), a long answer ("story", "explain"), a Bash tool call that waits for the
permission card ("run", "tool"), a failure ("simulate error"), otherwise an echo.
`window.__app` exposes the controller, view, avatar and bridge for debugging.

## Tests

* `npx vitest run tests/unit/app` — chunker, speech text, controller (fake bridge/player/TTS/STT/mic),
  speech queue, lip-sync mapping, VAD/resampler/WAV, mic (fake getUserMedia), player (fake Web
  Audio), Markdown parser/renderer, mock bridge, voice client, Web Speech, permissions, UI logic.
* `npx playwright test` — the built app in Chromium (SwiftShader) with the mock bridge: boot +
  hologram pixels, streaming states, safe Markdown + copy, permission cards, interrupt, error
  toasts, settings drawer + renderer switch, minimal mode, hotkeys, click-through, spoken replies
  with lip-sync (`voice=fake`), push-to-talk through Chromium's fake microphone, and the full loop
  against the real Python voice server in `--fake` mode (skipped when Python/FastAPI are missing).
  Screenshots go to `$LM_SHOTS_DIR` (default `test-results/screenshots`).
